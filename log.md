# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 14, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Finished Makers Academy Weekend Project (Airport Challenge)

**Thoughts:** It has been a full week since I started Makers! 

I've learnt a tremendous amount this week, particularly the process of TDD. First, feature tests. Then, unit tests. You're only allowed to write/touch your code after that. It's a fascinating departure from the haphazard write-code-first-and-hope-for-the-best approach I'd mostly been taking and after a week of repeating it, I see the benefits of it. It organises your code and ensures you are only writing code that is targeted at solving whatever you want your programme to do. 

The weekend challenge tested the things we learnt this week. We were required to build a programme which controlled the flow of airplanes into an airport. I struggled again with doubles and mocking but have wrapped my head around it a bit more. I need to be better at seeing the logical path a double takes. I did discover some other cool stuff though such as being able to generate custom errors and the magic of Rubocop (a fierce code checker which blasts you with all the syntax mistakes in your work). I've also tried to stick (perhaps slightly fanatically) to the principles of SRP (otherwise known as Single Responsibility Principle) which has resulted in what I hope is cleaner and more readable code. 

**To Work On**: Isolating unit tests more quickly or even doing it from the get-go instead of going back and refactoring it as such. 

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
