# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 09, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Finished Chris Pine Chapters 1-14 (Ruby), started Codewars journal 

**Thoughts:** I struggled with recursion and lambdas/procs the most. I need to do a few more recursion exercises to truly wrap my head around it and also look up what lambdas/procs are commonly used for. While I have a grasp of the differences between them, I feel that understanding the different situations they are each used for would strengthen this understanding. 

I've also started my long overdue Codewars journal (mostly to start making a conscious effort to review model solutions, break them down and form some takeaways). 

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
